Animal Crossing Item Cataloger 2.0
=========
11/25/2013

Animal Crossing Item Catalog was designed to make keeping track of which items you have access to easier.  It has
since been expanded to allow sorting and searching by categories, sets, and styles.  Included with the program should
be a masterIndex.txt file, which contains a list of all the items and their categories, and a LICENSE.txt file.  After
running, a settings.ini file will be created to save the window position and other options, and a userIndex.txt file which
will contain a list of items that the user has compiled.

The program is broken into 4 different tabs.  The program will open to the "Add" tab, which the user can use to add items
to the user list.  If the "Make master list read only" option is deselected in the "Options" tab, then items can be added
and removed from the master list as well.  The item name is entered into the text field at the bottom, it can be added by 
using the return key or the add button.  A message will be displayed regarding the success or failure of the operation.  
If the return key was used, the text will automatically be highlighted so the next item can be entered.  Items only need to
have the correct sequence of letters to be entered.  Spaces, hyphens and punctuation will be ignored.  Items that contain
accents will accepted as long as the item name using the same letter with no accent.  The remove button will look 
for the item specified by the text field and remove it from the user list if found.  If the list is not currently
read only, then the item will be removed from the master list too.  The right panel will change depending on whether the 
read only option is selected.  If it is selected, the right panel will be a list of the item's attributes.  If the list is
not read only, then there will be choose boxes on the right which can be used to specify item properties before adding to 
the list.

The second tab is the "Browse" tab.  It allows you to manually browse through the list to view items.  The filters below
can be used to narrow down the population of the list.  By default, the list will contain all the items in the master list,
with the items not owned by the user grayed out.  If the "owned items" box is checked, the list will only display items
on the user list.  The choose boxes at the bottom are used to filter the list to the specified categories.  Items can be
selected from the left panel to view their information in the right panel.  The area below the list contains a counter
for how many items the user has collected, as well as their percentage of total items found.

The third tab is the "Options" tab.  Each option is defined below:

Language - Change the language in which the program is displayed.  Currently, only the item names will be changed to the
selected language.  The languages available are English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Japanese.

Make master list read only - Determines whether or not items added and removed can change the master list.  The "Add" and
"Browse" tabs will change appearance depending on this setting.  The list for Animal Crossing New Leaf is complete, the only
reason someone should deselect this option is if they want to create a new list for a different game.

Quick add and remove in browser - Allows the user to toggle whether or not an item is on the user list by clicking on it in
the "browser" tab.  Multiple items can be toggled by clicking and dragging.
  
Files are automatically saved every time an action is performed in the program.  If you need to contact me, send an email
